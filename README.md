# Scrabble

This is a web-based Scrabble game, written in Ruby using the Camping microframework (no Rails!),
supporting a PostgreSQL or local file system backends.

You can play with other people by giving them the game URL and autogenerated passwords (no AI
players though). It allows games in Polish and English using several board variants, and is fully
localised in these two languages.

Most of the code was written in 2011 for Ruby 1.9 when I was young and stupid, and so may not be of
very high quality and may not fully work today. The toy itself is very fun, and I still like the
basic design.

I'm not sure why I did not release it back then, but surely it will feel better here than rotting
away on my hard disk.
